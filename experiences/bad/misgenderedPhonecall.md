# Misgendering

The preface to this is that i am a very recently out trans woman and have had zero vocal therapy sessions so while my voice is in the androgenous vocal range (min average 140 high average 190) and despite having femme mannerisms I could easily be read male, both in person or over the phone and i think this is totally reasonable, i don't take it personally and correct people. 99% of the time people are fine, move on and switch to use she/her pronouns for me.

That 1% of the time however, they are almost always in the tech sphere, like the recruiter I talked to recently. They were not happy for me to correct them at all.

The situation was a simple call to talk about an opportunity, nothing concrete, no commitments and the recruiter was a referral from a friend, they knew my name beforehand and the conversation started fine but went off the rails almost immediately whilst giving my details over the phone for future contact.

I was asked my title, and i gave Miss, they laughed and said they would put down Mr, i objected politely assuming they thought i was joking before and not taking it badly but they baulked. Then they made an inappropriate comment. Then i hung up. How i felt at the time was angry, dissapointed, upset, honestly a little humiliated, but what i didn't feel. Was surprise.

Misgendering trans people is an act of [violence](https://everydayfeminism.com/2017/01/misgendering-trans-people-is-violence/) that silences and humiliates. When asked to change a pronoun, or title, or manner of address, please assume sincerity and do so without hesitation.
