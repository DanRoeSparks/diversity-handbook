# Ideas

This is for anything that you feel might help affect inclusivity and diversity in a positive way. It can also include personal experiences, but would ideally be written in a way someone could follow to implement the idea themselves.

- Talk about intersectionality. Diversity without intersectionality ignores structural bias. Here's an example of how to talk about this in government service teams https://medium.com/@vickytnz/from-team-to-allies-how-government-service-teams-can-work-together-to-reduce-internal-inequalities-499e3cba214c
- Allow for different ways of contributing. Typical meetings are the domain of the chatty. Liberating Structures counters this http://www.liberatingstructures.com/ 
- Find out what good looks like for inclusive hiring. For example, the service design agency Snook has started to create a resource for this https://inclusivedesignrecruitment.co.uk
- Team Discovery Sessions: This will allow for the team to learn together and help foster an inclusive environment and also make sure knowledge is transferred across the team.
- This is particularly good for getting to know a new team and make people aware of your circumstances i.e. if you have children and need to do the school run on specific days, people will know not to book meetings for times you can't make.
- Be aware that people in your team might be relatively junior and need more support than folks with more experience. Ask them how best they'd like to be supported - if you're a developer, see if they want to pair on slightly harder tickets, or offer in-person code reviews for their work.
