# Diversity or Opportunity Scholarships

There are a number of opportunities on offer for diverse members of the community which allow them access to conferences, training and a whole bunch more. These are often provided via sponsor companies around the world to help people who wouldn't usually be able to attend events by giving them a free conference ticket, a reduced rate for training or even a full travel and accommodation bursary to those who could benefit from it.
