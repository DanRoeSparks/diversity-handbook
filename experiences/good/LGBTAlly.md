# LGBTQIA+ Ally program

At IBM we have an initiative in play that allows staff members to learn more about the LGBTQIA+ community and learn how to support said members in the work place by becoming a person who can be approachable and support your fellow members of staff regardless of race, gender, orientation, age, disability or belief. The core idea of the program is to provide a wholesome inclusive environment where people can be themselves without fear of being ostracized. 

The core ideas of the program are as follows:

- Learn about diversity in the work place.
- Talk to others about diversity.
- Learn about the various orientations and pronouns in play in the LGBTQIA+ community.
- Respect your fellow colleagues.
