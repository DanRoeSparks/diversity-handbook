# Communities for under-represented groups

There are a few communities in the UK and around the world that allow people from under-represented groups in technology to come together, learn and teach one another. They're a great place for newcomers to tech, and set a good precedence for diversity and inclusion within the wider technology community. 
As a business, you can often apply to sponsor sessions for these communities - this varies depending on the group, but often it means providing a venue, an employee or two to let folks into the building, and maybe food.
